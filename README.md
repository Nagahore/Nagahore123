This Flutter application showcases a versatile multi-screen mobile app with three primary functionalities: 
user sign-in, user sign-up, and a simple calculator. The app uses a MaterialApp structure, with the HomeScreen as the main entry point.
The HomeScreen employs a BottomNavigationBar and a Drawer for easy navigation between the SignInScreen, SignUpScreen, and SimpleCalculator. 
The SignInScreen and SignUpScreen provide basic user input fields and buttons for user authentication tasks, with transitions to other screens upon button presses.
The SimpleCalculator feature is a basic arithmetic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, displaying results dynamically.
The overall design follows Flutter's best practices, using StatefulWidget for dynamic state management and clean, modular code structure for maintainability and readability.
